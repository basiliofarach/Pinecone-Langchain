1. Understanding BSOD
What is BSOD?
The Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), also known as a stop error or bug check, is a critical error screen displayed by the Windows operating system. When the system encounters a fatal error that prevents it from continuing operations, it crashes, displaying a blue screen with diagnostic information.

Common Causes of BSOD
Driver Issues: Outdated, corrupted, or incompatible drivers.
Hardware Failures: Faulty RAM, hard drives, or other hardware components.
Software Conflicts: Conflicting applications or system services.
Overheating: Excessive heat causing hardware to malfunction.
System File Corruption: Damaged or missing system files.
Malware: Viruses or malware causing system instability.
2. Initial Steps
Safe Mode
Safe Mode starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. It can help you determine if the issue is related to default settings and basic device drivers.

How to Enter Safe Mode:

Restart your computer.
Press F8 (or Shift + F8 for some systems) before the Windows logo appears.
Select Safe Mode from the Advanced Boot Options menu.
If the BSOD does not occur in Safe Mode, it indicates that the problem is likely caused by a driver or software conflict.

System Restore
System Restore can revert your system to a previous state when it was functioning correctly.

How to Use System Restore:

Boot into Safe Mode (as described above).
Open the Control Panel.
Navigate to System and Security > System > System Protection.
Click System Restore and follow the prompts to choose a restore point.
Check for Hardware Issues
Ensure all hardware components are properly connected. Run built-in diagnostics to check for hardware problems.

Steps to Check Hardware:

RAM: Use the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool.
Hard Drive: Run chkdsk to check the integrity of your hard drive.
Running Windows Memory Diagnostic:

Press Windows Key + R to open the Run dialog.
Type mdsched.exe and press Enter.
Choose Restart now and check for problems.
Running Check Disk (chkdsk):

Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
Type chkdsk /f /r and press Enter.
Restart your computer to allow chkdsk to run.
3. Diagnostic Tools
Event Viewer
Event Viewer logs system events, errors, and warnings, which can help identify the cause of BSOD.

How to Access Event Viewer:

Press Windows Key + X and select Event Viewer.
Navigate to Windows Logs > System.
Look for error entries around the time of the BSOD.
BlueScreenView
BlueScreenView is a third-party tool that analyzes minidump files created during a BSOD and provides detailed information.

How to Use BlueScreenView:

Download and install BlueScreenView from NirSoft.
Run BlueScreenView to view the crash details and identify the faulty driver or module.
